# Deploying & developing gemini_addons18

This repo is the **authoritative source** of the Odoo 18 solution. It ships a
complete Docker stack (Odoo + PostgreSQL). Odoo core is the official `odoo:18`
image (this repo's custom code lives in `/opt/extra-addons`); pin the image for
reproducibility instead of vendoring the multi-hundred-MB Odoo source.

```
docker-compose.yml            prod / Dokploy (Odoo + Postgres)
docker-compose.override.yml   local dev overlay (ports, live mount, reload)
Dockerfile                    odoo:18 + python reqs + entrypoint

docker/odoo.conf.template     all odoo.conf keys <- ${ENV}
.env.example                  every tunable
```

Everything is configured through `.env` (`cp .env.example .env`). Nothing odoo
needs is hard-coded.

## Local development

Requirements: Docker + Docker Compose, and the `_vendor` submodules populated:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
make hooks                    # once per clone: pre-commit checks (layout +
                              # selection_reasons.md coverage, see platform/README.md)
cp .env.example .env          # then edit secrets
make up                       # build + start (publishes 8069/8072, live reload)
make logs
```

First run on a fresh database — create and init it once:

```bash
INIT_DB=odoo make up          # creates db "odoo" with base + own modules
# then clear INIT_DB from .env so it doesn't re-check every boot
# open http://localhost:8069  (master pw = ADMIN_PASSWD)
```

### Debugging (VS Code + debugpy)

The repo ships `.vscode/launch.json` + `tasks.json` (debugger setup is shared;
personal `.vscode` scratch stays gitignored).

```bash
make debug            # = DEBUG=1 DEBUGPY_WAIT=1 docker compose up --build
```

Then in VS Code run **"Odoo: Attach (Docker debugpy)"** (port 5678). Breakpoints
in your modules map via `${workspaceFolder} -> /opt/extra-addons`. `DEBUGPY_WAIT`
blocks boot until you attach; drop it to start immediately and attach anytime.
Debugging forces single-process (the dev overlay already sets `WORKERS=0`).

> Prefer running Odoo natively (no Docker) against your local source? The
> multi-root `odoo18.code-workspace` still has the **"Python: Odoo"** launch
> config that runs `odoo-bin` directly.

The dev overlay bind-mounts the repo into the container, so editing python/xml
hot-reloads (`--dev=reload,qweb,xml`). Useful targets (`make help`):

| target            | what |
|-------------------|------|
| `make up/down`    | start / stop stack |
| `make logs`       | tail odoo |
| `make shell`      | bash in container |
| `make odoo-shell` | odoo python shell |
| `make psql`       | psql into the db |
| `make upgrade`    | `-u` own modules (`m=mod1,mod2` to target) |
| `make submodules` | bump `_vendor` to latest 18.0 |

> The override disables boot-time auto-upgrade so restarts are fast. Upgrade
> explicitly with `make upgrade`.

---

## Production via Dokploy

1. **Create app** → type **Compose**, point it at this git repo, branch `18.0`,
   compose file `docker-compose.yml` (the repo-root one — see "Root compose is a
   symlink" below). Enable **recursive submodule** clone so
   `third_party_addons/_vendor` is populated.
2. **Environment** → paste your `.env` values (at minimum `ADMIN_PASSWD`,
   `DB_PASSWORD`). For a fresh database set `INIT_DB=<name>` on the first
   deploy, then clear it. Set `UPGRADE_DB=<name>` for ongoing upgrades.
3. **Domain** — two options:
   - *UI (simplest):* add **two** domain entries, both host `odoo.example.com`,
     both service `odoo`, HTTPS + letsencrypt:

     | Path | Port | Purpose |
     |------|------|---------|
     | `/`  | 8069 | normal HTTP traffic |
     | `/websocket` | 8072 | longpolling/gevent — **required** when `WORKERS>0` |

     Without the second entry the websocket falls through to 8069 and the UI
     hangs on "connection lost" / live chat + notifications stop working.
   - *Compose labels:* set `DOMAIN` in env, uncomment the Traefik `labels` +
     `networks` blocks in `docker-compose.yml`. The second router sends
     `/websocket` to `GEVENT_PORT` — same split as the two UI entries above.

   Multi-db stack (e.g. prod + staging): repeat the domain pair for **every**
   host and set `DBFILTER=(?i)^%d$` — see *Host → database routing* below.
4. **Deploy.** On boot the entrypoint renders the config, waits for Postgres,
   creates any `INIT_DB` databases, upgrades every `UPGRADE_DB` database, and
   serves. Missing dbs in `UPGRADE_DB` are skipped (never auto-created).

`PROXY_MODE=True` is required behind Traefik. Volumes `db-data` and `odoo-data`
(filestore + sessions) persist across redeploys.

### Root compose is a symlink (don't turn it back into a wrapper)

The product repo's root `docker-compose.yml` is a **symlink** to
`platform/docker-compose.yml`, not a thin `include:` wrapper. This is load-bearing:

* Dokploy's **domain** feature parses the compose file *statically* and does
  **not** expand `include:`. A wrapper therefore exposes zero services, and
  attaching a domain fails with *"service odoo does not exist in the compose"*.
  A symlink presents the real `services:` (`db`, `odoo`) at the repo root.
* Pointing Dokploy **directly** at `platform/docker-compose.yml` is *not* a fix:
  compose then sets the project dir to `./platform`, so `context: .` and
  `dockerfile: platform/Dockerfile` resolve to `platform/platform/*` (build
  fails), **and** the repo-root `.env` Dokploy writes is no longer auto-loaded
  (prod loses `DB_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_PASSWD`, …).
* The symlink keeps the project dir at the repo root, so build paths and the
  root `.env` resolve exactly as they do locally — while the stack stays shared
  in the submodule (no per-product duplication).

Keep Dokploy's **Compose Path = `./docker-compose.yml`**. `make up` and the
Makefile already use this same root path, so nothing else changes.

### Private submodules & Dokploy auth

Dokploy authenticates only the **top-level** clone. Its GitHub-App provider
injects a token into the parent URL, but that token is **never** passed to
submodule clones — so a **private** `_vendor` submodule fails with
`could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`. Which fix you need depends on
whether the submodule lives under the **same GitHub account** as the product repo:

**A. Same account → relative URL (no secret).**
If the product repo and the private submodule are under the same owner (e.g.
both under `T-Altendorf`), keep Dokploy on the **GitHub-App provider** and make
the submodule URL **relative** in `.gitmodules`:

```ini
[submodule "src/third_party_addons/_vendor/organize_urself"]
	url = ../organize_urself.git        # NOT https://…/T-Altendorf/organize_urself.git
```

Git resolves a relative submodule URL against the parent's *authenticated* origin
URL, so it inherits the App token automatically. Requirements: the Dokploy GitHub
App is installed on that account with access to **both** repos, and recursive
submodules are enabled. This is the preferred pattern — zero keys.

**B. Cross-account → SSH provider + account key.**
If the submodule is under a **different** owner than the product repo (e.g. repo
under `GeminiLabTec`, submodule under `T-Altendorf`), a relative URL would inherit
the *wrong* account's token and still fail. Instead switch the whole app to SSH,
because Dokploy's generic **Git provider** exports `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` for the whole
clone and git **does** propagate that to submodules:

1. Register an **account-level** SSH key (Settings → SSH keys, *not* a per-repo
   deploy key) on an account that can read **both** repos — i.e. it owns the
   product repo and is a **collaborator** on the submodule repo.
2. In Dokploy set the app source to the **Git provider** with the **SSH** URL
   (`git@github.com:OWNER/repo.git`, colon before owner, trailing `.git` — an
   `https://…` URL silently skips all SSH/known_hosts setup and clones over HTTPS).
   Attach the key; keep submodules enabled.
3. Set the submodule URL in `.gitmodules` to SSH too
   (`git@github.com:OWNER/submodule.git`).

Dokploy then runs `ssh-keyscan` (populating `known_hosts`, which fixes
`Host key verification failed`) and reuses the same key + known_hosts for the
recursive submodule clone.

**Local dev with pattern B:** the SSH `.gitmodules` URL fails on dev machines
that authenticate to GitHub via `gh` over HTTPS (no registered SSH key). Don't
change `.gitmodules` — run `make dev-remotes` (also part of `make submodules`),
which rewrites `git@github.com:` submodule URLs to HTTPS in **local** git config
and the submodule's origin only. One-time prerequisite: `gh auth setup-git`.

> ⚠️ GitHub free/Education plans can't set a collaborator to **read-only** — the
> collaborator gets **write**, and the account key could therefore push to the
> submodule repo. Compensate with **branch protection** on the submodule's
> deploy branch (require a PR, block direct/force pushes); that needs GitHub Pro.

### Ports & reverse proxy (no host ports in prod)

In production the odoo container publishes **zero** host ports — it only
`expose`s 8069 (http) and 8072 (websocket) on the docker network. A reverse
proxy on that same network maps your domain to those internal ports. This is the
docker-native version of your host-nginx `upstream 127.0.0.1:8070` — the
upstream just becomes the **service name + internal port**:

| your old host nginx        | dockerized                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `server 127.0.0.1:8070;`   | `server odoo:8069;`       |
| `server 127.0.0.1:8073;`   | `server odoo:8072;`       |
| nginx listens 80/443       | only the proxy publishes ports |

Two ways to run the proxy:

- **Dokploy/Traefik** — add **two** domain entries in the UI for the same host
  (`/` → 8069 and `/websocket` → 8072), or use the `${DOMAIN}` labels in
  `docker-compose.yml`. Traefik sets `X-Forwarded-*` and terminates TLS; you
  publish nothing. The `/websocket` route is required when `WORKERS>0`.
- **Self-managed nginx** (mirrors your current vhost exactly):
  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.nginx.yml up -d
  ```
  Config lives in `deploy/nginx/templates/default.conf.template` (driven by
  `${DOMAIN}`). Mount your existing `/etc/letsencrypt` to terminate TLS there,
  or keep it HTTP behind Dokploy. Don't combine with the dev override.
- **Inner VPN, no reverse proxy** — see "Dangerously exposed ports" below.

### Dangerously exposed ports (opt-in, off by default)

Neither `db` nor `odoo` publishes a host port in prod. Two overlay files can
turn that on, kept **separate** on purpose so enabling VPN access to the odoo
UI never drags raw Postgres onto the network with it.

| overlay | publishes | env |
|---|---|---|
| `platform/docker-compose.dangerously-expose-odoo.yml` | odoo http + websocket | `ODOO_EXTERNAL_PORT` (8069), `ODOO_EXTERNAL_GEVENT_PORT` (8072) |
| `platform/docker-compose.dangerously-expose-db.yml` | raw Postgres | `DB_EXTERNAL_PORT` (5432) |

Enable by listing the overlay in `COMPOSE_FILE` in the product's `.env` —
colon-separated, relative to the repo root, base file first:

```bash
# odoo on an inner-VPN box with no proxy in front
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:platform/docker-compose.dangerously-expose-odoo.yml
PROXY_MODE=False                 # nothing is terminating in front now

# postgres, one-off remote dump/restore — REMOVE and redeploy afterwards
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:platform/docker-compose.dangerously-expose-db.yml
DB_EXTERNAL_PORT=5433
```

Compose reads `COMPOSE_FILE` from `.env`, so nothing else changes; without it
the overlays are never loaded and `docker compose ps` shows no published ports.

> ⚠️ These bind `0.0.0.0` and bypass TLS entirely — odoo serves its login page
> over plain HTTP, and Postgres is cleartext TCP guarded only by `DB_PASSWORD`.
> Only enable on a box that is not publicly reachable, and firewall the ports
> to the VPN subnet / your own IP. Two stacks on one host will collide on these
> ports — give one different `*_EXTERNAL_*` values.

Two things that do **not** work, both verified the hard way:

* **A `ports:` entry on `odoo`/`db` with an "empty = off" default.** A `ports:`
  entry always publishes; an empty host port just publishes on a *random*
  public port (`0.0.0.0:60141->8069/tcp`), which is worse than a fixed one.
* **A profile-gated sidecar with `network_mode: "service:odoo"` + `ports:`.**
  `docker compose config` validates it, but `up` always fails with
  `conflicting options: port publishing and the container type network mode` —
  a container sharing another's netns cannot publish ports. Overlay files are
  the only mechanism that actually yields *zero* published ports by default.

> **Dokploy:** it invokes compose with an explicit `-f`, which overrides
> `COMPOSE_FILE`. Verify on the target app that the ports really appear before
> relying on this there; the `.env` route is what the Makefile/CLI uses.

### Host → database routing (multi-db, staging subdomains)

Odoo picks the database **per request, before URL routing**, from exactly two
sources (`_get_session_and_dbname` in `odoo/http.py`): the session cookie, or —
for fresh sessions — *"exactly one db matches the dbfilter"*. The `?db=` query
param only helps on `auth='none'` routes (`/web/login`, the db manager), where
`ensure_db()` seeds the session. Emailed links — `/web/signup` invitations,
`/web/reset_password` — are `auth='public'` routes, which **do not exist** for
a db-less request. Consequence, verified the hard way: with two dbs and
`DBFILTER=.*`, every invitation/reset link 404s for anyone without a session
cookie; deleting the second db "fixes" it because the exactly-one path fires
again. Multiple dbs on **one** hostname can therefore never fully work — the
mapping host → db must be unique.

**Standard scheme — subdomain == db name (case-insensitive):**

```bash
DB_NAME=False
DBFILTER=(?i)^%d$
```

`%d` is the first DNS label of the request host (`odoo.example.com` → `odoo`,
`odoo-staging.example.com` → `odoo-staging`); `%h` would be the full host.
Each host then matches exactly one db, with zero proxy configuration. The
`(?i)` makes the match case-insensitive: hostnames always arrive lowercase,
so a legacy mixed-case db (`AltendorfIT` @ `altendorfit.example.com`) works
**without a rename** — renames are only needed when the *name* differs, not
the case. (Plain `^%d$` if you prefer enforcing lowercase db names.) Rules:

* subdomain must equal the db name ignoring case — and never keep two dbs
  differing only by case, both would match.
* every host needs its own Dokploy domain pair (`/` → 8069, `/websocket` → 8072).
* fleet convention: prod db `odoo` @ `odoo.example.com`, staging db
  `odoo-staging` @ `odoo-staging.example.com` — same container, same Postgres,
  mutually invisible before login. Refresh staging with
  `make dbtest from=odoo to=odoo-staging` (then neutralize mail/crons).
* list all of them in `UPGRADE_DB=odoo,odoo-staging` so boot upgrades hit each.

**Alternative — free-form db names (`dbfilter_from_header`):** keeps any db
name; the proxy maps host → filter via a request header (this replaces the old
host-nginx `proxy_set_header X-Odoo-dbfilter` vhost setup). Needs the module
in `server_wide_modules` (`base,web,dbfilter_from_header`), `PROXY_MODE=True`,
and a per-host Traefik `headers` middleware. Dokploy's Domains UI cannot attach
middlewares — use compose labels (note `$$` escapes `$` in compose):

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.acme-dbf.headers.customrequestheaders.X-Odoo-Dbfilter=^AcmeProd$$"
  - "traefik.http.routers.acme.rule=Host(`acme.example.com`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.acme.middlewares=acme-dbf"
  # + entrypoints/tls/service lines, and a second /websocket router per host
  #   with the SAME middleware (else live chat lands on the wrong db)
```

Prefer the subdomain scheme: nothing can strip it, no server-wide module, and
db names double as documentation. Use the header only where a rename is truly
impossible.

**Renaming a db to fit the scheme:** Odoo 18's manager UI has no rename
button, but the RPC service still has one — it renames the database **and**
its filestore in one call (`exp_rename`). It is gated by db management, so
temporarily set `LIST_DB=True`, redeploy, then:

```bash
curl -s https://odoo.example.com/jsonrpc -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"call",
  "params":{"service":"db","method":"rename",
            "args":["<ADMIN_PASSWD>","OldName","odoo"]}}'
```

Set `LIST_DB=False` again and update `DB_NAME`/`DBFILTER`/`UPGRADE_DB`
references. Manual equivalent (odoo stopped):
`ALTER DATABASE "OldName" RENAME TO "odoo"` **plus**
`mv $DATA_DIR/filestore/OldName $DATA_DIR/filestore/odoo` — forget the second
and every attachment/asset 404s. Don't backup/restore just to rename (slowest
path, same result). Either way sessions are invalidated (users re-login) and
**already-emailed links embed the old db name — re-send open invitations**.

### Databases, the manager, and a test/staging instance

Odoo selects the database **before login**, and the setting is **global** — so
"admin sees all DBs, users see only one" is impossible within a single instance.
The web DB manager (`/web/database/manager`) is gated only by the master password
(`ADMIN_PASSWD`), and it's fully disabled when `LIST_DB=False`.

Recommended layout — **prod stays locked, a second app is your admin/test console:**

| | prod app | test / admin app |
|---|---|---|
| `DOMAIN` | odoo.example.com | test.example.com |
| `DB_NAME` | `False` | `False` |
| `DBFILTER` | `(?i)^%d$` (subdomain == db, see above) | `.*` (manager lists every DB) |
| `LIST_DB` | `False` (clean, no manager) | `True` (DB manager enabled) |
| `UPGRADE_DB` | `prod` | `test` |
| `WORKERS` | `2` | `0` (cheap) |

Prod users land on `odoo` with no picker and no manager exposed. The test app's
manager can create/backup/restore **all** DBs (including prod) when it points at
the same Postgres — protect it with a strong `ADMIN_PASSWD`.

**Cost of the second app is small, and you control it:**
- The `gemini-odoo18` image layers are **shared** on disk — not doubled.
- An idle Odoo uses ~0% CPU; the only real cost is ~250–350MB RAM at `WORKERS=0`.
- **Stop it in Dokploy when you're not testing → ~0 overhead.** Start on demand.

**Don't even need a second Odoo for DB *management*** — the CLI covers it:
```
make dblist                        # list all databases
make dbtest from=odoo to=test      # clone prod -> fresh test copy
make dbbackup db=odoo              # dump to ./backups
make dbrestore db=test file=...    # restore
make dbcreate db=foo               # create + init base + own modules
make dbdrop db=test                # drop
```
A second running Odoo is only worth it when you want to *click around* in test
data. After cloning prod into a test DB, neutralize outgoing mail / crons before
using it.

Sharing one Postgres between two Dokploy apps: give the test app no `db` service
and set `DB_HOST` to the prod Postgres over a shared Dokploy network — **or**
just let the test app run its own Postgres (~40MB, fully isolated, safer staging).

### Reproducible builds
Pin the base image by digest in `.env`:
```
ODOO_IMAGE=odoo@sha256:<digest>
```
Vendor module versions are pinned by the `_vendor` submodule commits. Bump them
deliberately with `make submodules && git add src/third_party_addons/_vendor`.

---

## How module automation works

The entrypoint manages databases via two env vars:

- **`INIT_DB`** — one-shot fresh database creation. Comma-separated list of db
  names. Each db gets `base` + `UPGRADE_MODULES` + `INSTALL_MODULES` installed,
  and the admin password set to `ODOO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Already-existing dbs are
  skipped. **Set it, deploy once, then clear it.**
- **`UPGRADE_DB`** — comma-separated list of dbs to run `-i` / `-u` on every
  boot. Missing dbs are **skipped with a warning** (never auto-created). Empty
  or `"False"` = skip all upgrades (fast restart).

`INSTALL_MODULES` runs `-i` (use once per fresh DB, then clear).

### `UPGRADE_MODULES` — three modes

| value | behaviour | boot cost |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` **(recommended)** | checksum-based: upgrade only addons whose files changed | seconds when nothing changed |
| `<comma list>` | upgrade exactly these modules | small, fixed |
| `all` | force-upgrade every installed module | full, **every** boot |
| empty | skip upgrades entirely | none |

**`auto`** uses OCA `module_auto_update` (vendored in `oca_server_tools`, must be
in `selection.txt`). It sha1-hashes every installed addon directory, stores the
hashes in `ir.config_parameter`, and upgrades only those that differ — then
saves new hashes *after* a successful run, so a failed upgrade retries rather
than being silently skipped. Odoo cascades an upgrade to dependent modules, and
vendor submodule bumps change file hashes, so both are caught automatically.

The entrypoint installs `module_auto_update` on first use (a cheap SQL check
avoids booting Odoo just to find out), then runs, with Odoo imported as a
library:

```python
env['ir.module.module'].upgrade_changed_checksum()
```

This deliberately does **not** go through `odoo shell`. The shell builds its
session by calling `res.users.context_get()` *before* it reads the piped-in
script, and that read prefetches every stored `res.partner` column. So the first
boot after a module adds a stored field to a core model, the shell would die on
`column ... does not exist` before it could run the upgrade that adds that very
column — a boot loop where the schema fix needs the schema it is there to fix.
Loading the registry as a library reads no business data, so the upgrade always
gets to run.

If the checksum upgrade fails anyway, the entrypoint falls back to a full
`odoo -u all --stop-after-init`, then re-saves the hashes so the next boot is
cheap again. `-u all` syncs every schema during registry load, before a row is
read, so it cannot deadlock the same way. It is slow, but it only runs when the
cheap path has already failed — never on a normal boot. If the fallback fails
too, the boot aborts rather than serving a half-upgraded database.

> First run after enabling `auto` upgrades **everything** — there are no saved
> hashes yet, and the module deliberately errs toward safety. Subsequent boots
> are cheap. (`_save_installed_checksums()` can seed hashes without upgrading,
> but only when you are certain disk and DB are already in sync.)

**`all`** has two sharp edges, both hit in practice: it costs the full upgrade
on *every* restart (there is no change detection — `load_data` re-runs for every
module regardless), and it dependency-checks every installed module, so a single
unmet python dep anywhere — including in a legacy module you no longer use —
raises `UserError` and blocks startup entirely.

`auto` and `all` are *modes*, not module names. The `INIT_DB` path handles this:
`auto` installs `module_auto_update` on the fresh db, `all` is dropped. Name real
modules in `INSTALL_MODULES` — splicing a mode into `-i` yields a dummy that Odoo
silently ignores, leaving a fresh db with `base` only.

Examples:
```bash
UPGRADE_MODULES=auto             # only what changed (recommended)
UPGRADE_MODULES=my_mod,other     # exactly these
UPGRADE_MODULES=all              # everything, every boot
UPGRADE_DB=UUs                   # upgrade one db every boot
UPGRADE_DB=UUs,UUs_Test          # upgrade multiple dbs
UPGRADE_DB=                      # skip upgrades entirely (fast restart)
INIT_DB=NewClient                # create a fresh db (one-shot, then clear)
```

## Secrets at rest (`RUNNING_ENV` / `ENCRYPTION_KEY`)

Modules holding third-party credentials (API keys, PSD2 signing keys) should not
keep them readable in the database — a dump, a backup or a replica would carry
them along. The OCA `data_encryption` module (from `OCA/server-env`) stores such
values as Fernet ciphertext in its `encrypted.data` model, with the key read
from `odoo.conf` rather than from any table.

The entrypoint renders that config for you:

```bash
RUNNING_ENV=prod                 # names the key set
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<fernet key>      # 32-byte urlsafe-base64
```

which becomes `running_env = prod` plus `encryption_key_prod = …` appended to
`$ODOO_RC`. Two environments can therefore hold different secrets against the
same codebase — restoring a prod dump into staging leaves the ciphertext
undecryptable there, which is the point.

Generate a key with:

```bash
python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

It must be a real Fernet key, not a passphrase — `data_encryption` feeds the
value straight to `Fernet()`.

> **Keep the key in a password manager, not only in `.env`.** Losing it makes
> every stored secret permanently unreadable; there is no recovery path.

Both variables are optional. Setting neither leaves secrets in cleartext and the
entrypoint says so at boot. Setting `ENCRYPTION_KEY` without `RUNNING_ENV` is a
hard error rather than a silent fallback — a half-configured key would otherwise
look like it worked while still storing plaintext. `$ODOO_RC` is `chmod 600`
since it now carries the key alongside `db_password` and `admin_passwd`.

## Python requirements
The image installs, at build time:
- every `third_party_addons/{_vendor,_static_vendor}/*/requirements.txt`
- the repo-root `requirements.txt` (own/custom extras)

Set build arg `INSTALL_VENDOR_REQS=0` for a slim image and curate
`requirements.txt` yourself. `_static_vendor` modules have no requirements file
today — add their deps to the root `requirements.txt` (or drop one beside the
copied module).
